# Banner-Slider
Banner Slider / Carousel

Technical Exam - Banner Slider / Carousel
Create a public github/gitlab repository for this project
Create a page that would have a banner slider / carousel
One image should be displayed at a time, but should have 2 more images that would automatically slide from left to right at 1 second
You may use any language/framework to produce the banner and data source itself as long as you are not using a specific library that produces a carousel/banner like https://glidejs.com/
You may use any HTML element/structure as long as it follows the HTML5 standards
The images and data must come from an API/local data source 
Feel free to choose from the available public APIs (https://scryfall.com/docs/api)
You can also create a simple API/webserver that would serve the data to produce the banner slider
(optional) image should be draggable to scroll to the next/previous image in the banner
(optional) design with mobile-first in mind
(optional) create a docker container that would serve the page, feel free to choose any webserver / docker image
